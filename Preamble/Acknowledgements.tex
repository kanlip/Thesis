I want to express my sincere gratitude to my research advisor, Dr Junhao Gan, for the guidance, support, and encouragement throughout this project. I am grateful for his willingness to share his expertise and knowledge with me, and for his patience and understanding when I made mistakes. I am also grateful to my family and friends for their support and encouragement. I could not have completed this project without their love and support.
